description: >
  WL-BISINDO class split into 16 base, 6 validation, and 10 test (novel) classes.
  Classes ranked by (count, mean_dist_to_centroid) using features from AUTSL-pretrained SL-GCN;
  richer classes assigned to base, scarcer to val/test.

num_classes: 32

base_classes: [27, 31, 17, 8, 24, 25, 2, 26, 28, 0, 23, 29, 30, 14, 15, 7]
val_classes: [19, 20, 6, 4, 10, 1]
test_classes: [21, 22, 11, 13, 3, 12, 9, 18, 5, 16]
